## The Last.fm Debloater

### What is this?

This is a Firefox addon written in TypeScript which mitigates some of the design choices regarding the music website [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/) in the form of a handy options menu.

I wrote this addon primarily for myself, but I figured I might as well share it with the other four people who still use Last.fm. Turn it on and leave it be or untick some checkboxes if you want, depending on what suits your fancy.

### What is this written in?

- Javascript,
- WebExtensions API.

### What's the point?

The betterment of Last.fm as a website. It's down to personal preference, obviously, but as someone who's been a user since 2007, I became used to things being a certain way.

### Additional notes

Please note that the existence of this addon is not meant as a slight to whoever's in charge of design at Last.fm - I'm sure they're significantly better at these things than I am. The only reason I wrote the addon is to make my personal experience with the website more enjoyable.
